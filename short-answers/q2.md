# Question
What is the difference between `.then` and `.catch`? What are the similarities?

# Answer
`.then` is for when a promise is fulfilled and `.catch` is for when a promise is rejected. They are both the outcomes of the promise, whether it is fulfilled or rejected.

# Teacher Feedback

No lie told! However, for similarities, you could have also mentioned that they both take in callback functions!
