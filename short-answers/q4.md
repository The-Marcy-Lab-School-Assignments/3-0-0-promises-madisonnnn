# Question
with `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, what do the arguments that you pass into `resolve/reject` do?

# Answer
`resolve/reject` are the outcomes of the promise being fulfilled or rejected. For example, if the outcome of a rejected promise is `console.log('error')`, then the outcome of a rejected promise would be `rejected`, which will print `error`.
