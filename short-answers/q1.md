# Question
Consider the following code:

```js
Promise.resolve('Inside promise').then(console.log);
console.log('Outside promise')
```

Which prints first: `Inside promise` or `Outside promise`. More importantly, can you explain why?

# Answer
`Outside promise` gets printed first because synchronous code, which console.log() is, gets printed first and then the asynchronous code, such as a Promise.
